K-MEANS CLUSTERING PROJECT REPORT
---------------------------------

Objective:
----------
To perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering on a synthetic Mall Customers-like dataset.

Dataset:
--------
- File: data/customers.csv
- Size: 200 rows
- Features: Age, Annual Income (k$), Spending Score

Methodology:
------------
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Standardized numerical features (Age, Annual Income, Spending Score).
2. Dimensionality Reduction
   - Applied PCA (2 components) for visualization.
3. Optimal Clusters
   - Used Elbow Method (inertia vs k) to suggest k=4.
4. K-Means Clustering
   - Performed clustering with k=4.
   - Visualized clusters in PCA space and original feature space.
5. Evaluation
   - Calculated Silhouette Score to measure clustering quality.

Results:
--------
- Optimal number of clusters (Elbow): 4
- Silhouette Score (k=4): ~0.40 (indicating fair separation of clusters).
- Cluster Sizes:
  * Cluster 0: group of customers with medium income and spending.
  * Cluster 1: group of customers with high income but low spending.
  * Cluster 2: group of customers with low income and variable spending.
  * Cluster 3: group of customers with high income and high spending.

Outputs Generated:
------------------
- Plots:
  * plots/income_vs_spending_raw.png
  * plots/pca_2d.png
  * plots/elbow_inertia.png
  * plots/clusters_pca.png
  * plots/income_spending_clusters.png
- Data:
  * data/customers_clustered.csv (with cluster labels)

Conclusion:
-----------
K-Means successfully segmented the synthetic customer dataset into 4 groups with distinguishable spending and income patterns. These insights can help businesses design targeted marketing strategies and personalized offers.
